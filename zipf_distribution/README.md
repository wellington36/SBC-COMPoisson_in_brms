## Zipf distribution

For a positive integer $k = 1, 2, \dots, N$, the Zipf distribution is defined as:

\[
P(X = k) = \frac{1 / k^s}{\sum_{n=1}^N 1 / n^s}
\]

where:
\begin{itemize}
    \item $s > 1$ is the exponent characterizing the distribution,
    \item $N$ is the number of elements (possibly infinite),
    \item the denominator is a normalization constant to ensure the probabilities sum to 1.
\end{itemize}
